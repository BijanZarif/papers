\section{Introduction}
It is difficult to overestimate the importance of medical researches of the human blood circulatory system,
because the knowledge from this area are extremely practical and significant. Each year, approximately 250 000
procedures are performed in the world to repair or replace damaged heart valves \cite{yoganathan}, and this
value tends to increace \cite{yacoub}. The solution of scientific and technical problems of the artificial valves 
creation depends on correct understanding of the fluid flow interaction with valve leaflets. Mathematical modeling
of the dynamics of artificial heart valves allows to get more complete understanding of processes inside them and helps
to find the ways to improve their design. There are many researches devoted to the mathematical and numerical modeling
of the dynamics of the heart valve. Most of them can be divided into two large groups.

First group is related to the finite element methods (\cite{taylor}, \cite{zhang}, \cite{black}). They may well handle
the complex geometry of the heart, bu the necessity to take into account the interaction between the fluid and flexible walls
leads to permanent rebuilding of the computational grid to meet the changing geometry of the object of research.
This results to significant expenses of time and computational resourses.

In this paper we consider a second approach, which is related to the immersed boundary method (\cite{pescin_1977},
\cite{boyce_2011}, \cite{ma_x_2013}, \cite{pilhwa_2010}). It can be used for the problems with complex geometry, and it doesn't
required the grid modification.

There are various improvements of this method, because of the need to model more and more complex problems. In the research \cite{fai_2013}
a formulation of this method was proposed for the three dimensional problem of the flow of two nonmixing (separated by flexible barries)
fluids of different viscosity and density. In the papers \cite{jian}, \cite{lee} an application of this method for the two dimensional problem of
the two component fluid flow.

In this work we propose to describe the blood flow in the flexible large blood vessels and the artificial heart valve as a three dimensional
nonstationary flow of the viscout incompressible fluid with variable viscosity and density (see \cite{gummel}, \cite{geidarov},
\cite{milosevic}, \cite{dolgov}). Thus the goal of this work is to build a mathematical model and a solution method of the problem
of artificial heart leaflet dynamics inside a blood vessel in view of the inhomogeneous structure of the blood, and also about the
mixture (formed elements) motion inside vessel.

\section{Mathematical formulation of the problem}

We consider a nonstationary problem of blood flow inside vessel with valve. Blood consists of the plasma and formed elements, which are approximately
45\% of the entire volume \cite{karro}. Vessel walls and valve leaflets consists of the large number of thin collagen fibers, they are flexibe
and can change their form depending on the fluid flow. The aortic valve, which are placed at the outlet from the left ventricle to the aorta, and provide
one-way movement of the blood, can be an example of this kind of systems (see Fig. \ref{fig:aortic_valve_example}):

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[height=6.2cm]{images/aorta_scheme_gray.png}
\caption{Aortic valve and its location inside heart}
\label{fig:aortic_valve_example}
\end{figure}

We model the blood as a viscous incompressible inhomogeneous two component fluid with variable viscosity, and vessel wall and valve leaflets as a
liquid impermeable surface with specified stiffness. Vessel and valve leaflets are deformed by a fluid pressure.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=12.5cm]{images/area_3d.png}
\caption{Scheme of the boundaries of the computational domain}
\label{fig:area_3d}
\end{figure}

Because the source of the blood motion in vessels is the pressure during the cardiac cycle, we will describe the problem of the blood flow
by the following nonstationary system of differential equations of Navier-Stokes \cite{gummel}:
\begin{gather}
    \label{eq:navier_stokes:motion}
    \frac{\partial \vec{u}}{\partial t} + (\vec{u} \cdot \nabla) \vec{u} = - \frac{1}{\rho} \nabla p + \nabla \sigma + \vec{f}\\
    \label{eq:navier_stokes:continuity}
    \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot (\rho \vec{u}) = 0 
\end{gather}

with the initial and boundary conditions:
\begin{gather}
    \label{eq:navier_stokes:velocity_conditions}
    \vec{u}(\bar{x}, 0) = \vec{u}_0 \qquad \vec{u}|_{\Gamma_1, \Gamma_4} = \vec{u}_b \qquad u_{\Gamma_2, \Gamma3} = 0\\
    \label{eq:navier_stokes:pressure_conditions}
    p_{\Gamma_2} = p_{in} \qquad p_{\Gamma_3} = p_{out}
\end{gather}

where $\bar{x}=(x,y,z) \in \Omega$, $\vec{u}=(u,v,w)$ - velocity vector, $\vec{u}_b$ - velocity of the vessel wall and valve leaflet motion during the deformation,
$\rho=\rho(\bar{x}, t)$ - density, $p=p(\bar{x}, t)$ - pressure, $\sigma = \mu (\nabla \vec{u} + (\nabla \vec{u})^T)$ - viscous stress tensor,
$\mu = \mu(\bar{x}, t)$ - viscosity of fluid, $\vec{f} = \vec{f}(\bar{x}, t)$ - vector of body forces, which is futher used to determine form of the vessel and valve leaflets. 

Density $\rho$ and viscosity $\mu$ are defined by following relations \cite{gummel}:
\begin{gather}
    \label{eq:viscosity}
    \mu = c (\mu_2 - \mu_1) + \mu_1\\
    \label{eq:density}
    \rho = c (\rho_2 - \rho_1) + \rho_1
\end{gather}

where $\rho_1$, $\mu_1$ - density and viscosity if fluid (plasma), $\rho_2$, $\mu_2$ - density and viscosity of mixture (formed elements), $c$ - concentration of mixture. Concentration $c=c(\bar{x}, t)$, $c \in [0, 1]$ of mixture are determined as a solution of equation:
\begin{gather}
    \label{eq:convection}
    \frac{\partial c}{\partial t} + \vec{u} \cdot \nabla c = 0
\end{gather}

with initial conditions:
\begin{gather}
    \label{eq:convection:conditions}
    c(\bar{x}, 0) = c_0(\bar{x}), \bar{x} \in \Omega
\end{gather}

and boundary conditions at the inlet boundary:
\begin{gather}
    \label{eq:convection:conditions}
    c(\bar{x}, t)|_{\Gamma_2} = c_s(\bar{x}, t)
\end{gather}

where $c_0, c_s$ are predefined functions.

Lack of definition for one component of velocity vector at the inlet-outlet is the one of issues for computational solution of this kind of problems.
It can be solved by the using the original equations (\ref{eq:navier_stokes:motion}) - (\ref{eq:navier_stokes:pressure_conditions}) at the boundaries
$\Gamma_2$, $\Gamma_3$ for determine of missing components of the velocity vector (see details \cite{gummel}).

Motion of the vessel walls and valve leaflets is defined by forces, which returned it to the original position. Valve leaflets can be deformated much more,
than vessel walls. To describe the forces, arising due the valve deformation, we use following formula:

\begin{gather}
    \label{eq:boundary_force}
    F = \frac{\partial}{\partial s} (T \tau) + \frac{\partial^2}{\partial s^2} (E \cdot I \frac{\partial^2}{\partial s^2} X)
\end{gather}

where $\bar{q} = (q, r, s) \in \Gamma_4$, $X(\bar{q})$ - function for describing the surface of leaflets at the moment $t$, the coordinates $q, r, s$ chosen so
that the surface $X$ was presented by the large amount of parametric lines $s \rightarrow X(q^0, r^0, s)$, $T$ - tension, that arises due the stretching along $s$,
$E$ - Young's modulus, $I$ - cross-sectional moment of inertia (see \cite{boyce_2011}, \cite{pescin_2002}). Physically the formula above means,
that the valve leaflets are resist extension, compression (it's related to the first term with $T$, which is dependent on stiffness coefficient $k$),
and bending (this related to the second term, where $E$ and $I$ are referred as a stiffness coefficient $k_b$). Formula (\ref{qs:boundary_force}) allows to
take into account any changes of the valve shape.

To compture forces, arising due the deformation of the vessel, we use another formula, which allows to take into account only small changes of the shape:

\begin{gather}
    \label{eq:boundary_force_simple}
    F = k \|X - X_0\|
\end{gather}

where $\bar{q} = (q, r, s, t) \in \Gamma_1$, $X(\bar{q}, t)$, $X_0(\bar{q}, 0)$ - functions for describing the surface of vessel walls at the moment $t$ and at the initial time, $k$ - stiffness coefficient.

As shown in the works \cite{pescin_1977}, \cite{boyce_2011}, for modeling of the interaction between vessel walls, valve leaflets and the fluid flow we need
to compute the vector of body forces $f$ in the equation of Navier-Stokes, based on the force $F$, and determine current surface $X(\bar{q}, t)$ of the vessel and valve, based on the velocity vector field $\vec{u}(\bar{x}, t)$. This is done by using the following equations:
\begin{gather}
    \label{eq:interaction:velocity}
    \frac{\partial X}{\partial t}(\bar{q}, t) = \int_{\Omega} \vec{u}(\bar{x}, t) \cdot \delta (x - X(\bar{q}, t))\; dx\; dy\; dz\\
    \label{eq:interaction:force}
    \vec{f}(\bar{x}, t) = \int_{\Gamma} \vec{F}(\bar{q}, t) \cdot \delta (x - X(\bar{q}, t))\; dq\; dr\; ds
\end{gather}

where $\bar{q} = (q, r, s) \in \Gamma$ - point at the vessel wall or valve leaflet, $X = X(\bar{q}, t)$ - function for describing the surface
of vessel wall and valve leaflet at the momen $t$, $F = F(\bar{q}, t)$ - the force of resistanse to deformation,
$\vec{u}(\bar{x}, t)$ - fluid velocity vector, $\vec{f}(\bar{x}, t)$ - vector of body forces, $\delta$ - Dirac delta function.

Thus we build the model, which describes the motion of the viscous inhomogeneous incompressible fluid inside vessel with valve. In this model the fluid state
and the surface $\Gamma_1 \cup \Gamma_4$ are determined independently from each other, and the influence of the valve leaflets on the fluid is reflected by
relation (\ref{eq:interaction:force}) between the vector of body forces $\vec{f}(\bar{x}, t)$ from the equation (\ref{eq:navier_stokes:motion}) and the force of resistanse to deformation $F = F(\bar{q}, t)$ from the equations (\ref{eq:boundary_force}), (\ref{eq:boundary_force_simple}).

\section{Method of solution}

You are strongly encouraged to use \LaTeXe{} for the
preparation of your camera-ready manuscript together with the
corresponding Springer class file \verb+llncs.cls+. Only if you use
\LaTeXe{} can hyperlinks be generated in the online version
of your manuscript.

The \LaTeX{} source of this instruction file for \LaTeX{} users may be
used as a template. This is
located in the ``authors'' subdirectory in
\url{ftp://ftp.springer.de/pub/tex/latex/llncs/latex2e/instruct/} and
entitled \texttt{typeinst.tex}. There is a separate package for Word
users. Kindly send the final and checked source
and PDF files of your paper to the Contact Volume Editor. This is
usually one of the organizers of the conference. You should make sure
that the \LaTeX{} and the PDF files are identical and correct and that
only one version of your paper is sent. It is not possible to update
files at a later stage. Please note that we do not need the printed
paper.

We would like to draw your attention to the fact that it is not possible
to modify a paper in any way, once it has been published. This applies
to both the printed book and the online version of the publication.
Every detail, including the order of the names of the authors, should
be checked before the paper is sent to the Volume Editors.

\subsection{Checking the PDF File}

Kindly assure that the Contact Volume Editor is given the name and email
address of the contact author for your paper. The Contact Volume Editor
uses these details to compile a list for our production department at
SPS in India. Once the files have been worked upon, SPS sends a copy of
the final pdf of each paper to its contact author. The contact author is
asked to check through the final pdf to make sure that no errors have
crept in during the transfer or preparation of the files. This should
not be seen as an opportunity to update or copyedit the papers, which is
not possible due to time constraints. Only errors introduced during the
preparation of the files will be corrected.

This round of checking takes place about two weeks after the files have
been sent to the Editorial by the Contact Volume Editor, i.e., roughly
seven weeks before the start of the conference for conference
proceedings, or seven weeks before the volume leaves the printer's, for
post-proceedings. If SPS does not receive a reply from a particular
contact author, within the timeframe given, then it is presumed that the
author has found no errors in the paper. The tight publication schedule
of LNCS does not allow SPS to send reminders or search for alternative
email addresses on the Internet.

In some cases, it is the Contact Volume Editor that checks all the final
pdfs. In such cases, the authors are not involved in the checking phase.

\subsection{Additional Information Required by the Volume Editor}

If you have more than one surname, please make sure that the Volume Editor
knows how you are to be listed in the author index.

\subsection{Copyright Forms}

The copyright form may be downloaded from the ``For Authors"
(Information for LNCS Authors) section of the LNCS Website:
\texttt{www.springer.com/lncs}. Please send your signed copyright form
to the Contact Volume Editor, either as a scanned pdf or by fax or by
courier. One author may sign on behalf of all of the other authors of a
particular paper. Digital signatures are acceptable.

\section{Paper Preparation}

Springer provides you with a complete integrated \LaTeX{} document class
(\texttt{llncs.cls}) for multi-author books such as those in the LNCS
series. Papers not complying with the LNCS style will be reformatted.
This can lead to an increase in the overall number of pages. We would
therefore urge you not to squash your paper.

Please always cancel any superfluous definitions that are
not actually used in your text. If you do not, these may conflict with
the definitions of the macro package, causing changes in the structure
of the text and leading to numerous mistakes in the proofs.

If you wonder what \LaTeX{} is and where it can be obtained, see the
``\textit{LaTeX project site}'' (\url{http://www.latex-project.org})
and especially the webpage ``\textit{How to get it}''
(\url{http://www.latex-project.org/ftp.html}) respectively.

When you use \LaTeX\ together with our document class file,
\texttt{llncs.cls},
your text is typeset automatically in Computer Modern Roman (CM) fonts.
Please do
\emph{not} change the preset fonts. If you have to use fonts other
than the preset fonts, kindly submit these with your files.

Please use the commands \verb+\label+ and \verb+\ref+ for
cross-references and the commands \verb+\bibitem+ and \verb+\cite+ for
references to the bibliography, to enable us to create hyperlinks at
these places.

For preparing your figures electronically and integrating them into
your source file we recommend using the standard \LaTeX{} \verb+graphics+ or
\verb+graphicx+ package. These provide the \verb+\includegraphics+ command.
In general, please refrain from using the \verb+\special+ command.

Remember to submit any further style files and
fonts you have used together with your source files.

\subsubsection{Headings.}

Headings should be capitalized
(i.e., nouns, verbs, and all other words
except articles, prepositions, and conjunctions should be set with an
initial capital) and should,
with the exception of the title, be aligned to the left.
Words joined by a hyphen are subject to a special rule. If the first
word can stand alone, the second word should be capitalized.

Here are some examples of headings: ``Criteria to Disprove
Context-Freeness of Collage Language", ``On Correcting the Intrusion of
Tracing Non-deterministic Programs by Software", ``A User-Friendly and
Extendable Data Distribution System", ``Multi-flip Networks:
Parallelizing GenSAT", ``Self-determinations of Man".

\subsubsection{Lemmas, Propositions, and Theorems.}

The numbers accorded to lemmas, propositions, and theorems, etc. should
appear in consecutive order, starting with Lemma 1, and not, for
example, with Lemma 11.

\subsection{Figures}

For \LaTeX\ users, we recommend using the \emph{graphics} or \emph{graphicx}
package and the \verb+\includegraphics+ command.

Please check that the lines in line drawings are not
interrupted and are of a constant width. Grids and details within the
figures must be clearly legible and may not be written one on top of
the other. Line drawings should have a resolution of at least 800 dpi
(preferably 1200 dpi). The lettering in figures should have a height of
2~mm (10-point type). Figures should be numbered and should have a
caption which should always be positioned \emph{under} the figures, in
contrast to the caption belonging to a table, which should always appear
\emph{above} the table; this is simply achieved as matter of sequence in
your source.

Please center the figures or your tabular material by using the \verb+\centering+
declaration. Short captions are centered by default between the margins
and typeset in 9-point type (Fig.~\ref{fig:example} shows an example).
The distance between text and figure is preset to be about 8~mm, the
distance between figure and caption about 6~mm.

To ensure that the reproduction of your illustrations is of a reasonable
quality, we advise against the use of shading. The contrast should be as
pronounced as possible.

If screenshots are necessary, please make sure that you are happy with
the print quality before you send the files.
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[height=6.2cm]{eijkel2}
\caption{One kernel at $x_s$ (\emph{dotted kernel}) or two kernels at
$x_i$ and $x_j$ (\textit{left and right}) lead to the same summed estimate
at $x_s$. This shows a figure consisting of different types of
lines. Elements of the figure described in the caption should be set in
italics, in parentheses, as shown in this sample caption.}
\label{fig:example}
\end{figure}

Please define figures (and tables) as floating objects. Please avoid
using optional location parameters like ``\verb+[h]+" for ``here".

\paragraph{Remark 1.}

In the printed volumes, illustrations are generally black and white
(halftones), and only in exceptional cases, and if the author is
prepared to cover the extra cost for color reproduction, are colored
pictures accepted. Colored pictures are welcome in the electronic
version free of charge. If you send colored figures that are to be
printed in black and white, please make sure that they really are
legible in black and white. Some colors as well as the contrast of
converted colors show up very poorly when printed in black and white.

\subsection{Formulas}

Displayed equations or formulas are centered and set on a separate
line (with an extra line or halfline space above and below). Displayed
expressions should be numbered for reference. The numbers should be
consecutive within each section or within the contribution,
with numbers enclosed in parentheses and set on the right margin --
which is the default if you use the \emph{equation} environment, e.g.,
\begin{equation}
  \psi (u) = \int_{o}^{T} \left[\frac{1}{2}
  \left(\Lambda_{o}^{-1} u,u\right) + N^{\ast} (-u)\right] dt \;  .
\end{equation}

Equations should be punctuated in the same way as ordinary
text but with a small space before the end punctuation mark.

\subsection{Footnotes}

The superscript numeral used to refer to a footnote appears in the text
either directly after the word to be discussed or -- in relation to a
phrase or a sentence -- following the punctuation sign (comma,
semicolon, or period). Footnotes should appear at the bottom of
the
normal text area, with a line of about 2~cm set
immediately above them.\footnote{The footnote numeral is set flush left
and the text follows with the usual word spacing.}

\subsection{Program Code}

Program listings or program commands in the text are normally set in
typewriter font, e.g., CMTT10 or Courier.

\section{The References Section}\label{references}

In order to permit cross referencing within LNCS-Online, and eventually
between different publishers and their online databases, LNCS will,
from now on, be standardizing the format of the references. This new
feature will increase the visibility of publications and facilitate
academic research considerably. Please base your references on the
examples below. References that don't adhere to this style will be
reformatted by Springer. You should therefore check your references
thoroughly when you receive the final pdf of your paper.
The reference section must be complete. You may not omit references.
Instructions as to where to find a fuller version of the references are
not permissible.

We only accept references written using the latin alphabet. If the title
of the book you are referring to is in Russian or Chinese, then please write
(in Russian) or (in Chinese) at the end of the transcript or translation
of the title.

The following section shows a sample reference list with entries for
journal articles \cite{jour}, an LNCS chapter \cite{lncschap}, a book
\cite{book}, proceedings without editors \cite{proceeding1} and
\cite{proceeding2}, as well as a URL \cite{url}.
